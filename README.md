### **Huff playground**

Huff is a low-level programming language used to instrument macros inside of an EVM. This repo serves as a playground towards learning huff and lower level EVM details.
#### Introduction

Huff was created while writing a zk proof library (weierstrudel). At the time, this was something that could not be done in solidity.

Huff is about as close as you can get to the EVM in terms of assembly code.

- Most huff programs are macros, which can contain more macros or evm opcodes.
- When a macro is invoked, template params are supplied to the macro.
- Huff doesn't have functions or variables
- Ultimately, if your goal is to write gas-efficient contracts, huff is the way to go.


##### ERC20 Spec

A given ERC20 token has the following functions, all of which we will be implementing inside of a huff program (in the form of macros)
```
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint);
function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public view returns (uint);
function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public view returns (uint);
function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
function mint(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool);
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
```

**Variables:**
- We need to identify storage locations and map them to a variable.
- To do this, we create macros that refer to storage locations that the ERC20
contract is interested in (e.g: balance location, owner address location)

**Solidity Mappings:**
- Smart contracts store data using `sstore`, using a pointer to a storage location.
- Each storage location can contain upto 32 bytes of data.
- Mappings are instrumented by combining the mapping key with storage slot of the mapping. This is then hashed, resulting in a 32 byte storage pointer unique to the key and variable in context.

**Calldata:**
- Data structure that stores input data sent as part of a contract call / transaction. Huff can load calldata using the `calldataload` opcode. Although, we do need to mention the offset in calldata to start loading from. => costs `6 gas` to load a word from calldata.
- We instead duplicate the entirety of calldata, since it costs only `3 gas`

**Events:**
- Events have two important attributes - `topics` and `data`. Topics are created when an indexed parameter exists (e.g: `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`)
- `keccack256` hash of an indexed element is used as the database lookup index (TODO: dig deeper)
- **Event signature:** is the `keccack256` hash of the event signature (e.g: `Transfer(address)`, `Approval(address, address, uint)`)
- We arrive at the conclusion that we need to put the data associated with `topics` onto the stack.
